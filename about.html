            <p>Welcome to Noor's Path, where passion meets action. Together we can make a difference. Established on July 2024, our organization is driven by a vision to create a less toxic environment where orphans and less privileged children can enjoy their childhood and are not forced to mature sooner than better privileged peers.</p>
            <p>Our mission includes contributing to the children's education, celebrating notable days for children (such as Children's Day, International Day of the Boy Child, and International Day of the Girl Child), and providing basic necessities like clothing, feeding, and stationery, as well as childhood pleasures like toys and games. Overall, we aim to give these neglected children a space where they feel heard and prioritize their mental health.</p>

            <p>Our vision is to create a world where every child has access to quality education, healthcare, and basic necessities. We believe that every child deserves a chance to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances. By providing essential services and support, we hope to empower children to build a brighter future for themselves and their communities.</p>
