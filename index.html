                <p>On October 18, 2024, we had the incredible opportunity to visit Wesley Primary School in Ilorin, Kwara State, as part of our outreach program! 💖✨ It was a day filled with inspiration, empowerment, and hope as we engaged with 72 students, providing them with vital knowledge on menstrual hygiene, education, and sexual assault. Our goal was to inspire these brave girls to develop bold minds and embrace the limitless possibilities of their future.</p>
                <p>One of the most rewarding moments was distributing essential school supplies to all 72 students, giving them the tools to succeed and thrive in their education. Additionally, we provided 30 girls with water bottles, sanitary pads, and tissues promoting the importance of staying healthy and hydrated while pursuing their dreams. 🎒💧</p>
                <p>This outreach was a step toward building a brighter future where every girl feels empowered, supported, and unstoppable. 💪🌸 Thank you to everyone who contributed to making this day possible. Together, we are creating lasting change and making a difference in the lives of these young girls.</p>
